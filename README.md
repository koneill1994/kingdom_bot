# kingdom_bot

A reddit bot which would run a partially text-based risk-style game over reddit.  

[**Partially outdated design document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f14WI7LXzqelAXwRaoX8AQeXkZnzHfj1ZVnSahfWVds/edit?usp=sharing)

To run it you'll need your own obot.py file, which would have the proper credentials needed to access your reddit account.  To make one, [**follow the tutorial here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/comments/3cm1p8/how_to_make_your_bot_use_oauth2/)

The test subreddit I'm using is [**/r/TheFifthHorse**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFifthHorse/)

You can see the [**maps**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFifthHorse/wiki/index) and [**player list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFifthHorse/wiki/players) in their respective wiki pages.  

The bot would need mod access to the subreddit in order to update the maps, so I recommend changing the target subreddit to do your own testing.
